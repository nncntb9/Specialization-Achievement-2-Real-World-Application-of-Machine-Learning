# Specialization-Achievement-2-Real-World-Application-of-Machine-Learning
This project is a compilation of exercises for achievement 2 for the machine learning specialization focused on Real-World Application of Machine Learning. 

## Description
This achievement develops an understanding of the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in the real-world using python. Weather data for European weather stations is used to train, test, and optimize Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Random Forests. 

## Projects
This project presents 5 exercises on the following:
1. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
2. Complex Machine Learning Models and Keras Part 1
3. Complex Machine Learning Models and Keras Part 2
4. Evaluating Hyperparameters
5. Visual Applications of Machine Learning

## Summary
Results show that optimized convolutional neural networks have a high accuracy level whilst random forests are capable of projecting current weather. Developing Generative adversarial networks (GANs) is instrumental in predicting future weather conditions.
